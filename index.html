Srimad  Vedanta Desika or Thoopul Nigamaantha Desikan  (1268–1369)[1] is the most brilliant stalwarts of Sri Vaishnavism in the post-Ramanuja period. He was a poet, devotee, philosopher, logician and master-teacher (desikan).

He was a  disciple of Kidambi Appullar, also known as Aathreya Ramanujachariar, who himself was of a master-disciple lineage that began with Ramanuja. Swami Vedanta Desika is considered to be the avatar (incarnation) of the divine bell of Venkateswara of Tirumalai.

Early life
Srimad  Vedanta Desika was born in the year 1268 CE, to a pious couple named Ananta Suri and Totaramba, who named him ‘Venkatanatha’. When he was five, his maternal uncle, Kidambi Appullar took him to attend a spiritual discourse of Nadadhoor Ammal, a revered Sri Vaishnava scholar of that time. As soon as Ammal saw the divine radiance of the child, he stopped his discourse, and hugged Venkatanatha affectionately.

When Ammal told the audience that he had forgotten where he had stopped his discourse, it was Venkatanatha who reminded him immediately, to the astonishment of the assembled scholars. Deeply impressed, Ammal blessed him and predicted that Venkatanatha would become the main torch-bearer for Sri Vaishnavism.

When Desika turned seven, Kidambi Appullar accepted Venkatanaatha as his disciple, and taught him arts, sciences and scriptures. By the age of 20, Desika became famous for his mastery over poetry, logic, linguistics, science, Vedanta, debate, and allied arts.

Even though Desika was multi-faceted and famous, he lived a humble and simple life with the support of his wife, Thirumangai. He undertook a vow called uncha-vritti, whereby he depended wholly on the Supreme Lord for his household needs by accepting grains and vegetables donated by disciples voluntarily, without actively seeking it.

Desika stayed in several cities and towns throughout his life such as Thiruvaheendrapuram, Kanchipuram, Srirangam, Sathyagala and Melkote. He also travelled widely all over India on foot.

Literary works
At each place, he composed many different works in languages such as Tamil, Sanskrit, Prakrit and Manipravala (a mixture of Sanskrit and Tamil) that revealed his ingenuity, creativity, logic, linguistic expertise, devotional fervour and erudite scholarship.

He composed over hundred works in the following genre:
28 devotional poems in Sanskrit such as Hayagriva-stotram, Kamasika-ashthakam and Gopala-vimshati
24 devotional poems and treatises in Tamil such as Gitartha-sangraham and Charama-sloka-churkku
11 philosophical treatises such as Shata-dushani, Mimamsa-paduka and Tattva-mukta-kalapam
10 commentaries on the works of previous acharyas such as Stotra-ratna-bhashya, Chatus-shloki-bhashya and Tatparya-chandrika
5 Narrative poems such as his magnum-opus, the Paduka-sahasram, and the epic poem called Yadavabhyudaya which rivals the decorative poetry of Mahakavi Kalidasa’s works, and the Hamsa-sandesha
32 esoteric texts revealing the hidden meanings of prappati-marga such as Srimad Rahasya-traya-saram, Paramapada-sopanam, Amrita-ranjani and Amrita-svadhini
1 drama named Sankalpa-suryodayam
13 works on arts and sciences such as Bhugola-nirnayam and Silpartha-saram
4 works that codified religious rites and practices such as Sri-vaishnava-dinasari and Bhagavad-aradhana-vidhi
Appaya Dikshitar, the great mediaeval scholar appreciated Desika by composing a verse in Sanskrit:

evam vichintyas sarvatra bhavaah santi pade padhe kavi tarkika simhasya kavyeshu laliteshvapi

“Even in the simple and soft compositions of this lion of poetry and lion of logic, there is poetic excellence evident at every step he took, and indeed in every word he wrote.”

Desika composed his poems in various poetic metres. Vedic literature is written in the form of hymns set rhythmically to different metres, called ‘chandas’. Each metre is governed by the number of syllables specific to it. Poets are expected to conform to these norms in their compositions. Swami Desikan has employed 22 metres in the 862 verses he composed on presiding deities of various temples in India. The following are some of the compositions of Vedanta Desika that provide a glimpse of his mastery over poetry, logic, grammar and philosophy:

Hayagriva Stotram: a hymn on Lord Hayagriva, the Lord of Learning, who bestows real knowledge to the reciter, banishing the darkness of ignorance from within him.

Abheethistavam: a prayer to Lord Ranganatha for relief from different types of fear, ultimately seeking and being bestowed refuge at the lotus feet of the Lord

Achyutha Satakam: hundred verses in praise of the Lord of Lords Devanatha, in which Desika expresses his passionate love in the form of a bride

Bhagavat Dhyana Sopanam: twelve stanzas that describe the steps for meditating upon the Lord of Srirangam, Ranganathaswami

Dasavatara Stotram: describes the ten important incarnations of the Lord to protect the world and uphold the principles of dharma or righteousness

Daya Satakam: hundred verses eulogising the mercy or daya of the Lord of Tirumala. The work is divided into 10 decads, each portraying different qualities of the personified mother, Dayadevi. It commences with the short anushtab metre. Each successive decad employs a more complex metre, till it culminates in decorative poetry that is a sheer delight to hear.

Garuda Dandakam: A complex stotram composed in the Dandakam meter style, and has 108 aksharas in every Paadam. It is believed that Desikan composed it when a snake charmer challenged him to summon the mighty Garuda.

Sri Suti: a prayer to ‘Sridevi’ the Goddess of Fortune that is said to have been composed when a bachelor was sent to Desika, seeking financial help for his marriage. Since Desika himself lived a life of voluntary poverty, he took him to the temple of the Goddess and sang Sri Stuti. This culminated in a shower of gold coins, solving the financial problems of the young bachelor.

Sudarshanasthaka: eight verses set in the rare ‘dhritichhandas; metre praising the holy discuss-weapon of Lord Vishnu, wielded by the Lord to protect the virtuous.

Kamasikasthaka: is prayer of eight verses to Lord Narasimha who assumed a man-lion form to slay the demon Hiranyakashpu, and protect His devotee, Prahlada. Nyasa sutras: are texts composed by Desika which extract the essence of the sharanagati doctrine of self-surrender. These are the Nyasa Dasakam, Nyasa Vimsathi and Nyasa Tilakam.

Vairagya panchakam: five verses that describe the importance of renunciation or vairagya. The word ‘dhana’ or wealth, occurs eleven times, each with a different contextual meaning.

Hamsa-sandesha: is a lyric poem of 110 verses, reminiscent of Kalidasa’s Meghadhuta. It describes Lord Rama sending a message via a swan to his wife Sita, who was abducted by the demon king Ravana.

Yadavabhyudaya: is an epic poem of 24 cantos describing the destiny of the Yadava Kings, the dynasty in which Lord Krishna appeared. It is on par with the Kalidasa’s work called Raghuvamsa, which describes the dynasty of the Raghu kings, in which Lord Rama appeared.

Paduka Sahasram: composed of a thousand and eight verses spread over 32 divisions called paddhatis, on the holy sandals of the Lord Ranganatha. Desika was challenged by another scholar to compose 1000 verses in a night, and he completed this work in three hours. Verses in one section form pictorial patterns with the arrangements of the letters used.

Tamil works: Swami Desikan’s Works in Tamil are numerous, out of which two need special mention: Paramathabhangam, where he describes and refutes 15 schools of philosophy, and Aharaniyamam where he describes the correct types of food to be consumed by a Vaishnava.
